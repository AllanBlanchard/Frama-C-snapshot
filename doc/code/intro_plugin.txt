{1 _PluginName_ module}

{2 Introduction}

This is the {b internal} documentation of the _PluginName_ module.

Look at {{:../../index.html}Frama-C} to have an overview of the whole tool, 
including the {{:../html/Db._PluginName_.html}API of this module}.

While browsing the documentation, you will jump from public parts
to internal parts. So, the internal documentation have a light yellow
background (like this page) in order that you can recognize them.

Indexes :
{{:index_modules.html}Modules} ({{:modules-all.ps}internal graph},
{{:modules.ps} external graph}),
{{:index_types.html}Types} ({{:types.ps}graph}),
{{:index_values.html}Values},
{{:index_exceptions.html}Exceptions}.

(You are invited to use
{{:http://zvtm.sourceforge.net/zgrviewer.html}zgrviewer}
to view the .dot graphs because they are to big to be seen in image formats
(jpg or png)).

If your browser know how to deal with SVG format 
(for instance, firefox >= 1.5),
you can also have a look at the {{:modules.svg}relations between the files}
of the _PluginName_ module, and click on the nodes to go directly to their
documentation.
