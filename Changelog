Gui: December 9, 2008
	- Improved consistency of some information messages

Value: December 9, 2008
	- abstract structs are now supported in conjunction with
          option -lib-entry, and invalid to access.

Syntax: December 9, 2008
	- modified typeForInsertedCast hook to take as arguments the expression
	and its original type in addition to the destination type.

Makefile.template: December 2, 2008
	- bugs fixed

Logic: November 24, 2008
	- added support for (wide) string constants in ACSL formula.

Core: November 21, 2008
	- changed the definition of non-determinist functions in builtin.c
	  These functions no longer rely on a volatile variable.
   	  Analysis logs may change slightly as a result.

Value: November 21, 2008
	- introduced preliminary support for state reductions on a memory
	  read access. This should eliminate some redundant alarms.

Sparecode/Slicing : November 20, 2008

	and types.
	- unused global variables and types are now removed in sparecode
	analysis and slicing results.

	the function currently visited (fix bug #406)

Core: November 17, 2008
	- enum items now have their own type and are shared between declaration
	and use
	- new visitor methods for visiting compinfo, enuminfo, fieldinfo and
	enumitem (prevents potential misuse of copy visitor for these types)

Jessie: November 14, 2008
	- fixed bug with multiple labels in axiomatic definitions
	- added example tests/jessie/minimum_sort.c in Jessie tutorial

Jessie: November 10, 2008

Jessie: November 5, 2008

	programs. The solution is to require pointers that are compared to
	belong to the same allocated memory block, which can be expressed
	in logical annotations using equality of \base_addr constructs.

Impact Gui: November 4, 2008
	- New panel to manage impact analysis

Makefile.template: November 3, 2008
	- support for native compilation (require ocaml >= 3.11)

===============================================================================

Value: October 23, 2008
	- changed behavior of option -context-valid-pointers to make it
	more like the documentation says it is.

Value: October 23, 2008
	- fixed a bug introduced with the "value concatenation" feature

	would have the origin "Arithmetic" instead of "Misaligned".

Value: October 14, 2008

	of an expression. Differences are most visible in the
	results of options -input and -deps, and of course all
	the slicing options that make use of these.

	argument ~skip_base_deps from all functions in Db.Value
	that had one. This argument did not make sense.
