	      - code 5 is now: error raised when exiting Frama-C normally
	      - code 6: error raised when exiting Frama-C abnormally

-  Value      [2010/08/26] "assert(TODO)", used when a property to check in the
	      analyzed code cannot be expressed as ACSL and the user should
	      read the English explanation (e.g. "accessing uninitialized
	      left-value") instead, could look unprofessional to the superficial
	      onlooker. "assert(Ook)" will now be used instead.
-  Value      [2010/08/23] Lowered memory consumption slightly.
